# Spec Kit Assistant - Roadmap TL;DR

**Current Version**: 1.0.0
**Focus**: Scaffold-ETH Integration for Grant Application
**Updated**: 2025-10-14

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

AI-powered tool that makes Scaffold-ETH development **10x faster** through intelligent code generation, security automation, and best-practice enforcement.

---

## ✅ What Exists Today

**Core App**:
- ✅ Wrapper for GitHub Spec Kit with friendly UX
- ✅ Security hardened (environment variables, input validation)
- ✅ Multi-agent swarm framework

**Scaffold-ETH Integration** (NEW!):
- ✅ Generate ERC-20, ERC-721, Staking contracts
- ✅ Hardhat deployment scripts
- ✅ React components with Scaffold-ETH hooks
- ✅ 4-agent swarm (Contract Architect, Frontend Builder, Deployment, Security)

**Not Fully Working Yet**:
- ⚠️  Gemini coordinator (stubbed, not calling API)
- ⚠️  Swarms don't fully execute (show progress only)
- ⚠️  Remote server deployment (framework exists)

## 🗺️ The Plan

### Stage 1: Scaffold-ETH Excellence (NOW - Grant Focus)
**Goal**: Become THE tool for Scaffold-ETH development

#### Next 30 Days:
1. **Week 1-2**: Add 10+ contract templates (DeFi, NFT, DAO, Gaming)
2. **Week 3-4**: Security integration (Slither, Mythril, Foundry fuzz tests)
3. **Ongoing**: Document everything, demo videos, community feedback

#### What This Delivers:
- 20+ production-ready contract templates
- Auto-security auditing
- Multi-chain deployment (Optimism, Arbitrum, Base, Polygon)
- 90%+ test coverage on generated code
- Etherscan auto-verification

---

### Stage 2: Real Swarm Intelligence (Q1 2026)
**Goal**: Swarms actually build features autonomously

- Gemini Queen Coordinator (real API integration)
- Data Science Swarm (fully functional)
- Builder & UX Swarm (production ready)
- Web3 Builder (advanced DeFi patterns)

---

### Stage 3: Distributed Execution (Q2 2026)
**Goal**: Scale across local, remote, and cloud backends

- Remote server deployment (fully working)
- Multi-backend routing (local/remote/cloud)
- Fault tolerance (checkpointing, auto-resume)

---

### Stage 4: Polish & Production (Q3 2026)
**Goal**: Enterprise-ready with amazing UX

- Real-time progress indicators
- Web dashboard & terminal UI
- 80%+ test coverage
- CI/CD automation

---

### Stage 5: Platform & Ecosystem (Q4 2026+)
**Goal**: Community-driven plugin marketplace

- Plugin system
- Team collaboration
- Learning & optimization

---

## 📈 Success Targets

### Grant Period (3 months):
- 20+ contract templates
- 500+ GitHub stars
- 100+ weekly users
- Zero critical security issues
- >4.5/5 user rating

### End of Year 1:
- Standard tool for Scaffold-ETH
- 10+ community plugins
- Multi-chain support (5+ chains)
- Enterprise customers

## 🚀 Why This Matters for Scaffold-ETH

1. **Lower Barrier**: Beginners can build production dApps immediately
2. **Speed**: AI-assisted coding = 60% faster development
3. **Security**: Auto-apply best practices and security patterns
4. **Education**: Generated code is learning material
5. **Growth**: More devs building on Scaffold-ETH = stronger ecosystem

---

## 🎯 Grant Deliverables

- ✅ Phase 1: Basic integration (ERC-20, ERC-721, Staking) - **DONE**
- [ ] Phase 2: 10+ additional templates - **IN PROGRESS**
- [ ] Phase 3: Testing & security automation
- [ ] Phase 4: Multi-chain deployment
- [ ] Phase 5: Documentation & tutorials
- [ ] Phase 6: Community feedback & iteration

---

## 📊 Current Stats

- **Contracts Generated**: 3 (ERC-20, ERC-721, Staking)
- **Deploy Scripts**: 3 (Hardhat format)
- **Frontend Components**: 3 (React with Scaffold-ETH hooks)
- **Security Features**: OpenZeppelin, ReentrancyGuard, Ownable
- **Test Coverage**: Basic (needs expansion)
- **Multi-chain**: Not yet (local only)

---

## 🔥 Immediate Next Steps

**This Week**:
1. Add 5 DeFi contract templates
2. Add 5 NFT contract templates
3. Integrate Slither for security scanning
4. Generate comprehensive tests

**This Month**:
1. Multi-chain deployment support
2. Etherscan verification
3. Documentation & tutorials
4. Demo video for grant application

## 🤔 Questions?

- **"Will swarms really work autonomously?"** - Not yet fully, but Stage 2 makes them real
- **"Can I use this in production?"** - Generated contracts yes (review first), swarms not yet
- **"Does it support other tools besides Scaffold-ETH?"** - Yes, but Scaffold-ETH is primary focus
- **"Is it secure?"** - CLI is hardened, generated contracts use OpenZeppelin best practices
- **"When will Stage 2 be ready?"** - Q1 2026 (3-4 months after grant period)
