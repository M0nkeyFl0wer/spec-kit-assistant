# Security Improvements - SSH Credentials Sanitization

## What Happened

Previously, SSH credentials for the remote server were hardcoded in multiple files and committed to the public GitHub repository. This included:

- Hostname: REMOTE_HOST
- Username: REMOTE_USER
- Port: 8888

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Environment Variables
All SSH credentials now use environment variables configured in `.env` file:
```bash
REMOTE_HOST=your-server.example.com
REMOTE_PORT=22
REMOTE_USER=your-username
```

### 2. Enhanced .gitignore
Added comprehensive rules to prevent committing:
- Environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`)
- Development/building files
- SSH keys and credentials
- Build artifacts and logs

### 3. Files Sanitized
- ✅ `.env.example` - Generic placeholder values only
- ✅ `deploy-to-seshat.sh` - Now uses `${REMOTE_HOST}`, `${REMOTE_PORT}`, `${REMOTE_USER}`
- ✅ `ROADMAP.md` - Removed hardcoded SSH details
- ✅ `SPEC.md` - Updated to use environment variables
- ✅ `CONSTITUTION.md` - Added security best practices
- ✅ `BASH-COMMANDS.md` - Generic examples only

### 4. Git History Cleaning
Run `./clean-git-history.sh` to remove sensitive data from git history.

**Warning**: This is a destructive operation that requires force-pushing to GitHub.

## Setup for Users

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/spec-kit-assistant.git
   cd spec-kit-assistant
   ```

2. **Create your local .env file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Configure your remote server**
   Edit `.env` and set your own values:
   ```bash
   REMOTE_HOST=your-server.com
   REMOTE_PORT=22
   REMOTE_USER=your-username
   ```

4. **Store password securely in keyring**
   ```bash
   node -e "const keytar = require('keytar'); keytar.setPassword('remote-server', 'your-username', 'YOUR_PASSWORD');"
   ```

## Security Best Practices

### ✅ DO:
- Store credentials in `.env` file (never committed)
- Use system keyring for passwords
- Use environment variables in scripts
- Review `.gitignore` regularly
- Use `git-filter-repo` to clean history if secrets are committed

### ❌ DON'T:
- Hardcode hostnames, usernames, or ports
- Commit `.env` files
- Share credentials in documentation
- Use example credentials in production
- Commit private keys or certificates

## Files That Should NEVER Be Public

The following are now in `.gitignore`:
- `BASH-COMMANDS.md` (contains operational details)
- `GRANT-APPLICATION-SUMMARY.md` (private grant info)
- `CURRENT-STATE.md` (development notes)
- `ROADMAP-SUMMARY.md` (internal planning)
- `deploy-*.sh` (deployment scripts)
- `*-swarm.js` (building/testing scripts)
- `logs/`, `test*/`, `template/` (development artifacts)

## Clean Repository Structure

### Public (Committed):
```
spec-kit-assistant/
├── spec-assistant.js          # Main CLI entry
├── enhanced-swarm-orchestrator.js  # Swarm orchestration
├── src/                       # Source code
│   ├── character/             # Dog personality
│   ├── swarm/                 # Swarm agents
│   └── ...

├── README.md                  # Getting started
└── LICENSE                    # MIT license
```

### Private (Not Committed):
```
.env                          # YOUR credentials
BASH-COMMANDS.md              # Operational commands
deploy-to-seshat.sh           # Deployment scripts
*-swarm.js                    # Building scripts
logs/                         # Log files
template/                     # Development templates
```

## Future Prevention

### Pre-commit Hook
Consider adding a pre-commit hook to scan for secrets:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit

if git diff --cached | grep -E "(seshat|m0nkey|:REMOTE_PORT|password|secret|key=)"; then
    echo "ERROR: Potential secret found in commit!"
    exit 1
fi
```

### GitHub Secret Scanning
Enable GitHub's secret scanning alerts in repository settings.

### Code Review
Always review `git diff` before committing to catch accidental credential exposure.

## Questions?

If you notice any remaining security issues, please open a GitHub issue or contact the maintainer privately.

**Remember**: Security is everyone's responsibility. When in doubt, ask before committing!
