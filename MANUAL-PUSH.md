# 🐕 Manual GitHub Push Guide

If the automated script doesn't work, here's how to push manually:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Fill in:
   - **Repository name**: `spec-kit-assistant`
   - **Description**: `🐕 Friendly dog assistant wrapper for GitHub Spec Kit - Makes spec-driven development delightful!`
   - **Public** (checked)
   - **Add README** (unchecked - we already have one!)
   - **Add .gitignore** (unchecked - we have one!)
3. Click **"Create repository"**

## Step 2: Push Your Code

GitHub will show you instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
cd /home/flower/spec-kit-assistant

# Push to GitHub (repository already initialized)
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify

Visit: https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/spec-kit-assistant

You should see:
- ✅ README.md with dog ASCII art
- ✅ All your code
- ✅ Beautiful purple/pink/green branding

## Troubleshooting

### "Authentication failed"

Set up GitHub authentication:
```bash
# Option 1: Use SSH (recommended)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
# Add the key to GitHub: https://github.com/settings/keys

# Option 2: Use personal access token
# Create token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/spec-kit-assistant.git
```

### "Permission denied"

Make sure you're logged in as M0nkeyFl0wer on GitHub!
