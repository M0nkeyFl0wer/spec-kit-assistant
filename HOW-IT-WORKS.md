## ❌ What NOT to Do

```
🤖 Claude Code running everything
   │
   │ User: "Run spec-kit-assistant for me"
   ▼
   Claude just codes
   │
   │ Skips: Constitution, Spec, TODOs, Clarifications
   ▼
   ❌ Code without clear direction = Bad results!
```

## ✅ The Right Way

```
Terminal Window                    VS Code with Claude Code
┌─────────────────────┐            ┌─────────────────────┐
│                     │            │                     │
│ $ node spec...init  │            │  (not used yet)     │
│                     │            │                     │
│ 🐕 Creating spec... │            │                     │
│ 📋 TODOs created... │            │                     │
│ ✅ All clear!       │            │                     │
│                     │            │                     │
│ $ node spec...run   │───────────>│  🤖 Claude starts   │
│                     │            │  📝 Implements      │
│ 🐕 Deploying swarm  │            │  ✅ Tests pass      │
│                     │            │  🎉 Done!           │

## Why This Matters

### If Claude Runs Everything:
- ❌ No clear spec = vague implementation
- ❌ No constitution = inconsistent decisions
- ❌ No TODOs = missed requirements
- ❌ No clarifications = assumptions everywhere

### If YOU Run Spec Kit Assistant:
- ✅ Clear spec = focused implementation
- ✅ Constitution = consistent decisions
- ✅ TODOs = nothing missed
- ✅ Clarifications = no assumptions

## Think of it Like Movie Making

```
🐕 Spec Kit Assistant = The Director
   - Defines the vision
   - Creates the script
   - Plans the shots
   - Guides the process

🤖 Claude Code = The Crew
   - Executes the plan
   - Implements the vision
   - Follows the script
   - Does the actual work

👤 YOU = The Producer
   - Makes final decisions
   - Approves direction
   - Ensures quality
   - Owns the result
```

## Common Questions

### "But isn't this tool FOR Claude Code?"

**Sort of!** It's like saying "a movie script is for actors."

- The script (your spec) IS for actors (Claude)
- But the DIRECTOR (Spec Kit Assistant) guides YOU to write it
- The actors don't write their own script!

### "Why can't I just ask Claude to do everything?"

You can! But you'll get:
- Code without clear requirements
- Features you didn't actually want
- Inconsistent architecture
- Stuff that "works" but isn't what you needed

With Spec Kit Assistant:
- You think through WHAT you want first
- Then Claude implements it perfectly
- Following YOUR rules and vision

### "This seems like extra steps..."

It is! And that's the point!

**Without specs:**
```
Code → Test → Realize it's wrong → Recode → Test → Still wrong → Repeat
```

**With specs:**
```
Think → Spec → Code → Works first try → Ship
```

The "extra steps" at the start save MASSIVE time later!

## Ready to Try?

```bash
# In your terminal (not in Claude Code!):
node spec-assistant.js init "My Awesome Project"
```

Let Spec guide you through creating a proper spec.
Then watch Claude implement it perfectly! 🐕
