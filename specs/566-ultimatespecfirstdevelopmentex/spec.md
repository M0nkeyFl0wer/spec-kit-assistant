# Feature Specification: ultimate-spec-first-development-experience

**Feature Branch**: `605-ultimatespecfirstdevelopmentex`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: Ultimate spec-first development experience that ensures all development workflows naturally guide users toward creating proper GitHub Spec Kit specifications first, deploying efficiently with remote swarm integration, and maintaining continuous spec-code alignment throughout the development lifecycle.

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer using the Spec Kit Assistant, I want every development action to guide me toward proper specification creation first, so that all roads lead to well-documented, efficiently deployable code that maintains spec-code alignment throughout the development lifecycle.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer runs any command without an active spec, **When** they attempt to start implementation, **Then** the system guides them to create a GitHub Spec Kit specification first with character-driven prompts
2. **Given** a developer has created a specification, **When** they're ready to implement, **Then** the system automatically analyzes the spec and recommends optimal swarm deployment strategy for efficient execution
3. **Given** a developer is working on implementation, **When** their work drifts from the specification, **Then** the focus management system detects drift and provides gentle nudges back to spec alignment
4. **Given** a specification is complete, **When** deployment is initiated, **Then** the system deploys appropriate remote agents to Seshat for scalable implementation
5. **Given** todo items are created, **When** viewing progress, **Then** each todo references specific spec sections and validates against spec requirements

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to bypass spec creation entirely?
- How does system handle specs that are incomplete or non-compliant with GitHub Spec Kit format?
- What occurs when remote swarm deployment fails or agents become unresponsive?
- How does the system maintain context when switching between multiple active specifications?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST intercept all development commands and validate active specification status before execution
- **FR-002**: System MUST guide users to create GitHub Spec Kit compliant specifications when none exist
- **FR-003**: System MUST analyze specifications to recommend optimal swarm deployment configurations
- **FR-004**: System MUST deploy remote agents to Seshat for scalable implementation execution
- **FR-005**: System MUST continuously monitor implementation alignment with specification requirements
- **FR-006**: System MUST detect when development work drifts from specification and provide gentle nudges back to alignment
- **FR-007**: System MUST integrate todo management with specification sections for continuous tracking
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide character-driven guidance through Spec the Golden Retriever for delightful user experience
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain focus management to prevent context loss during Claude conversations
- **FR-010**: System MUST support both cute dog commands and traditional CLI interfaces for natural interaction
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate GitHub Spec Kit format compliance and guide enhancement when needed
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide real-time swarm monitoring and management capabilities
- **FR-013**: System MUST enable efficient resource allocation based on specification complexity analysis

### Technical Requirements
- **TR-001**: System MUST integrate with existing SwarmOrchestrator class for remote agent deployment
- **TR-002**: System MUST maintain session persistence across system restarts and conversation contexts
- **TR-003**: System MUST support WebSocket communication for real-time agent coordination
- **TR-004**: System MUST implement secure file operations with path validation for all spec and workspace management
- **TR-005**: System MUST provide sub-30-minute spec-to-deployment pipeline for rapid iteration

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Specification**: GitHub Spec Kit compliant document defining project requirements and acceptance criteria
- **SwarmConfiguration**: Definition of agent types, resource requirements, and deployment strategy for a specific specification
- **FocusSession**: Persistent tracking of implementation progress with spec alignment monitoring
- **TodoItem**: Task tracking entity with direct references to specification sections and validation criteria
- **RemoteAgent**: Deployed agent instance running on Seshat with specific skills and resource allocation
- **SpecCharacter**: Spec the Golden Retriever personality providing guidance and user experience enhancement
