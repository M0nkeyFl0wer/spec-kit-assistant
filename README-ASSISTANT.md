# 🌱 Spec Kit Assistant

**A friendly wrapper for GitHub Spec Kit with AI-powered swarm orchestration**

> Spec-Driven Development Made Easy with your loyal dog assistant! 🐕

## 🎯 What is This?

Spec Kit Assistant is an enhanced version of [GitHub's official Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit) that adds:

- 🐕 **Friendly Dog Assistant** - Guides you through spec-driven development
- 🤖 **AI Swarm Orchestration** - Deploy agent swarms for implementation & testing
- 🌱 **Beautiful UX** - Official Spec Kit colors with intuitive commands
- ⚡ **Seamless Integration** - Wraps the real `specify` CLI, doesn't replace it

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone <repo-url> spec-kit-assistant
cd spec-kit-assistant

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the assistant!
node spec-assistant.js
```

### First Project

```bash
# Create a new project
node spec-assistant.js init my-awesome-project

# Check project status
node spec-assistant.js check

# Create project principles
node spec-assistant.js constitution
```

## 📚 Commands

### Official Spec Kit Commands
These pass through to the real GitHub Spec Kit:

```bash
node spec-assistant.js init <PROJECT>       # Create new project
node spec-assistant.js check                # Check project status
node spec-assistant.js constitution         # Create project principles
```

### Enhanced Swarm Commands
AI-powered features added by this wrapper:

```bash
node spec-assistant.js run "implement login"  # Deploy swarm to implement
node spec-assistant.js test                   # Run comprehensive tests with swarm
node spec-assistant.js deploy "feature"       # Full deployment with orchestration
node spec-assistant.js swarm status           # Check active swarms
```

## 🎨 What Makes This Special?

### 1. True Fork, Not Reimplementation
- Uses the **real** GitHub Spec Kit under the hood
- Enhances, doesn't replace
- 100% compatible with official Spec Kit

### 2. Swarm Orchestration
Deploy specialized AI agent swarms:
- **Builder-UX Swarm** - Frontend & backend implementation
- **Red-Team Swarm** - Security testing & penetration testing
- **Data Science Swarm** - Analytics, ML, visualization
- **Production Swarm** - Deployment readiness checks
- **Security Fix Swarm** - Vulnerability patching

### 3. Official Spec Kit Branding
- Purple (#8B5CF6), Pink (#EC4899), Green (#10B981), Brown (#8B4513)
- 🌱 Seedling emoji represents growth
- Beautiful Unicode dog art

### 4. Dog Assistant Personality
Your loyal guide through spec-driven development:
- Friendly encouragement
- Clear phase guidance
- Helpful error messages
- Progress celebrations

## 🔧 How It Works

```
Your Command
     ↓
Friendly Dog Assistant (Node.js wrapper)
     ↓
┌─────────────┬────────────────────┐
│  Official   │   AI Swarm         │
│  Spec Kit   │   Orchestration    │
│  (Python)   │   (Optional)       │
└─────────────┴────────────────────┘
```

1. You run a command
2. Dog assistant shows helpful guidance
3. Command routed to:
   - Official Spec Kit for spec/check/constitution
   - Swarm orchestrator for run/test/deploy
4. Results displayed with friendly messages

## 🤖 Swarm Architecture

### Available Swarms

**Builder-UX Swarm**
- Frontend implementation
- Backend API development
- Full-stack features

**Red-Team Security Swarm**
- Penetration testing
- Security audits
- Vulnerability scanning
- Edge case testing

**Data Science Swarm**
- Data analysis
- ML model development
- Visualization
- Web scraping

**Production Readiness Swarm**
- Deployment checks
- Performance testing

### Deploying a Swarm

```bash
# Deploy a swarm with description
node spec-assistant.js run "implement user authentication with JWT"

# Swarm will:
# 1. Analyze requirement
# 2. Deploy specialized agents
# 3. Implement solution
# 4. Run tests
# 5. Generate documentation
```

## 🌍 Remote Execution (Seshat)

Deploy swarms to remote servers for heavy computation:

```bash
# Swarms can run on Seshat (remote GPU/CPU server)
# Configured via SSH: REMOTE_HOST:REMOTE_PORT
# Credentials managed securely via keyring
```

## 📖 Examples

### Create a New Project

```bash
$ node spec-assistant.js init my-app

🌱 GitHub Spec Kit Assistant
Spec-Driven Development Made Easy

🌱 Running: specify init my-app

[Official Spec Kit runs, creates project]

✅ Project created successfully!
```

### Run Implementation Swarm

```bash
$ node spec-assistant.js run "add dark mode toggle to settings"

🤖 Initializing swarm orchestrator...

📋 Task: add dark mode toggle to settings

🚀 Deploying Builder-UX Swarm...
   ✅ Frontend builder deployed
   ✅ Backend builder deployed

[Swarm implements feature]

✅ Swarm deployment completed!
```

### Run Security Tests

```bash
$ node spec-assistant.js test

🧪 Running tests with red-team swarm...

🛡️ RED TEAM UNIT TEST SWARM
🔍 Deploying Penetration Tester...
🔒 Deploying Code Security Auditor...
💥 Deploying System Exploit Specialist...

[Comprehensive security testing]

✅ All tests passed!
```

## 🎯 Architecture Principles

### From CONSTITUTION.md

1. **Authentic Fork** - Real Spec Kit, enhanced
2. **User Experience First** - Clear, friendly, fast
3. **Official Branding** - Respect Spec Kit colors/identity
4. **Code Quality** - Security, performance, maintainability
5. **Swarm Integration** - Optional, lazy-loaded, powerful

### From SPEC.md

- Wrapper startup: < 500ms
- Swarm lazy-load: < 100ms
- SSH to Seshat: < 2s
- Zero breaking changes to official Spec Kit

## 🛠️ Development

### Requirements

- Node.js >= 18.0
- Python >= 3.11 (for official Spec Kit)
- uv package manager (auto-installs)
