## üó£Ô∏è CORE WORKFLOW: THE RAMBLE COMMAND

### Voice-Driven Development Pipeline

```bash
# Activate conversational co-learning session
spec ramble

# System activates:
# 1. Local voice transcription (Whisper)
# 2. Real-time research validation
# 3. Intelligent interruption system
# 4. Obsidian knowledge integration
# 5. Spec building and swarm deployment
```

### Conversational Co-Learning Flow

VOICE AGENT: "Hold on! Found 3 existing projects - should we look?"

RESEARCH AGENT: "MIT study shows 40% efficiency with mesh networks!"

EXPERIMENT AGENT: "Building simulation now..."

PROTOTYPE AGENT: "Visual demo ready in 30 seconds..."
