        Hi! This is Spec, your loyal support dog for Spec Kit CLI.
        I'm here to help you turn your wild ideas into real projects!
```

## Why I Was Created 🎯

Ever had a brilliant idea but got stuck figuring out how to build it? That's exactly why my humans created me! I'm here to bridge the gap between **"I have this cool idea!"** and **"Look, I actually built it!"**

```
    💡 IDEA                    🔨 IMPLEMENTATION
      │                              │
      │        ╭─────────╮           │
      └────────┤  SPEC   ├───────────┘
               │ HELPERS │
               ╰─────────╯

    "What if we could..."  →  "Here's your working code!"
```

I help with two main things:
- **🧠 Ideation**: Turn vague thoughts into clear project specs
- **⚡ Implementation**: Generate the actual code to make it real

## How I Help You: Step-by-Step Workflow 📋

### Step 1: Tell Me Your Idea 💬

Just start talking! I love hearing about your projects, no matter how rough or incomplete they are.

```
    You: "I want to build something that tracks my habits..."

         ∩───∩
        (  ?   ?  )  ← Me, listening carefully
         \   ∇   /
          \_\_/_/
```

### Step 2: I Ask Smart Questions 🤔

I'll dig deeper to understand exactly what you want to build.

```
    Me: "What kind of habits? Daily, weekly, or custom frequencies?"
    Me: "Do you want charts and progress tracking?"
    Me: "Mobile app, web app, or command-line tool?"

         ∩───∩
        (  ◕   ◕  )  ← Me, getting excited about your idea!
         \   ∇   /
          \_\_/_/
```

### Step 3: I Create Your Project Spec 📝

I'll generate a complete specification document with everything clearly laid out.

```
    ╭──────────────────────────────────────╮
    │           PROJECT SPEC               │
    │                                      │
    │  📋 Requirements                     │
    │  🏗️  Architecture                    │
    │  🎨 UI/UX Design                     │
    │  🔧 Technical Implementation         │
    │  ✅ Acceptance Criteria              │
    ╰──────────────────────────────────────╯
```

### Step 4: I Generate Real Code 💻

Based on your spec, I'll create actual working code for your project.

```
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │  📁 your-awesome-project/           │
    │  ├── 📄 index.html                 │
    │  ├── 🎨 style.css                  │
    │  ├── ⚡ script.js                  │
    │  ├── 📋 README.md                  │
    │  └── 🧪 tests/                     │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘

         ∩───∩
        (  ★   ★  )  ← Me, proud of what we built together!
         \   ∇   /
          \_\_/_/
          *tail wagging*
```

### Step 5: We Iterate and Improve 🔄

Don't like something? Just tell me! I'll adjust the spec and regenerate the code.

```
    FEEDBACK LOOP:

    Build → Test → Feedback → Improve → Repeat
      ↑                                    ↓
      └────────────────────────────────────┘

    I'm patient and persistent - we'll keep
    going until you're 100% happy!
```

npm install

# Wake me up!
node src/index.js

## What Makes Me Special 🌟

### I'm Not Just a Template Generator

I actually understand your project and create custom solutions:

```
    ❌ Generic Template:        ✅ Custom Solution:

    "Here's a basic todo app"   "Here's a habit tracker with
                                AI-powered insights, streak
                                counters, and motivational
                                quotes - exactly what you
                                described!"
```

### I Speak Human, Not Tech Jargon

You don't need to know programming terms. Just tell me what you want!

```
    You say: "I want users to click a button and see sparkles"
    I understand: "onClick event handler with CSS animation"

         ∩───∩
        (  ◕   ◕  )  ← Me, translating human → code
         \   ~   /
          \_\_/_/
```

### I Remember Our Conversations

I keep track of what we've discussed so we can build on previous ideas:

```
    SESSION MEMORY:
    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
    │ Day 1: Discussed features   │
    │ Day 2: Refined UI design    │
    │ Day 3: Added user auth      │
    │ Day 4: Ready to deploy!     │
    └─────────────────────────────┘
```
