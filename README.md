## 🏗️ Swarm Stack Architecture

### **Production Components (BATTLE-TESTED)**
- **Enhanced Swarm Orchestrator** (`enhanced-swarm-orchestrator.js`)
  - Gemini Queen Coordinator with token optimization
  - Multi-swarm task coordination
  - Git integration strategies
  - 100% local fallback processing

- **Specialized Swarms Ready for Deployment**
  - `deploy-data-science-swarm.js` - ML/Analytics tasks
  - `production-readiness-swarm.js` - QA/Testing/Deployment
  - `security-fix-swarm.js` - Security audits and fixes
  - `deploy-builder-ux-swarm.js` - UI/UX development
  - `red-team-unit-test-swarm.js` - Testing and validation

- **Base Orchestrator** (`src/swarm/orchestrator.js`)
  - WebSocket agent communication
  - Secure file operations
  - Auto-scaling and health monitoring
  - Resource management

### **⚠️ CRITICAL: Architecture Rules**
```bash
# ✅ ALWAYS USE: Existing swarm stack
node enhanced-swarm-orchestrator.js deploy "task"

# ❌ NEVER CREATE: Custom coordinators
# Don't reinvent - use production-ready swarms!
```
