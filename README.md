## 🎯 Project Status

**✅ Core functionality working** - CLI operational, consultation working, agent UI functional.

### ✅ What Works
- ✅ **Character system** - Spec the Golden Retriever with ASCII art and personality
- ✅ **CLI commands** - All help menus and command structure functional
- ✅ **Interactive consultation** - Full conversation flow with Spec
- ✅ **Agent swarm UI** - Deployment interface with progress tracking
- ✅ **Security architecture** - Comprehensive security fixes implemented
- ✅ **Syntax clean** - All JavaScript files pass validation

### 🚧 Known Issues
- 🟡 **Agent swarm persistence** - Agents deploy but don't persist between sessions
- 🟡 **WebSocket verification** - Server claims to start but needs verification
- 🟡 **Interactive consultation** - Works but crashes on forced termination (expected behavior)

## 🚀 Installation & Testing

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- npm

### Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/spec-kit-assistant.git
cd spec-kit-assistant
npm install
```

### How to Use

```bash
# 1. View all available commands
node src/index.js --help

# 2. Start interactive consultation with Spec
node src/index.js init

# 3. Deploy agent swarm (UI functional)
node src/index.js swarm --deploy --scale 2

# 4. Monitor agent status
node src/index.js swarm --monitor

# 5. Test character demos
node demo.js
node test-basic.js
```

## 🌟 Planned Features

This assistant is designed to address user feedback from the GitHub Spec Kit community:

### 🎯 **Issue #385: Human Oversight**
- **Strategic checkpoints** instead of overwhelming approval requests
- **Smart risk assessment** - only interrupt for meaningful decisions
- **Three oversight modes** - Trust & Verify, Strategic, Full Control

### 🎯 **Issue #318: Documentation & Setup**
- **Interactive setup wizard** with visual guides
- **Step-by-step cloud integration** with cost protection
- **Character-guided experience** making complex concepts approachable

### 🎯 **Issue #253: Conversational Mode**
- **No more blank templates** - Spec asks intelligent questions
- **Progressive disclosure** - reveal complexity gradually
- **Context-aware follow-ups** - adapt based on your responses

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The project implements several key components:

### 🤖 **Agent Swarm System**
- **6 specialized agent types** - Quality Assurance, Security Scanner, Performance Monitor, Code Repair, Documentation, Deployment
- **WebSocket communication** - Real-time coordination between agents
- **Secure orchestration** - Token-based authentication and rate limiting

### ☁️ **Cloud Integration**
- **Google Cloud Platform focus** - Free tier optimization
- **Cost monitoring** - Budget alerts and optimization recommendations
- **Deployment templates** - Ready-to-use configurations

### 🛡️ **Security Architecture**
- **Input validation** - Path traversal prevention, file type restrictions
- **Secure WebSocket server** - Authentication, rate limiting, safe JSON parsing
- **Configuration security** - Environment-based secrets, no hardcoded defaults

### 🎬 **Multimedia System**
- **Voice synthesis** - ElevenLabs integration with personality-based speech patterns
- **Character art generation** - ASCII art with different moods
- **Interactive demos** - Step-by-step visual guides

## 🐛 Current Development Tasks

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Fix JavaScript syntax errors** - Resolve escaped apostrophe issues preventing CLI from running
2. **Complete interactive consultation** - Make the conversation engine fully functional
3. **Test agent swarm deployment** - Ensure WebSocket orchestration works end-to-end
4. **Validate cloud integration** - Test GCP deployment and cost optimization features

### Documentation Issues Fixed
- ❌ Removed references to non-existent documentation files
- ❌ Removed fabricated command examples that don't work
- ❌ Removed unsubstantiated performance claims
- ❌ Removed non-functional installation instructions
- ✅ Focused on actual working functionality
- ✅ Honest assessment of current project state

## 🤝 Contributing

This project needs help! Key areas:

1. **JavaScript syntax fixes** - Remove escaped apostrophes causing parsing errors
2. **Testing** - Verify each component works as intended
3. **Documentation** - Create real tutorials and guides (not placeholder links)
4. **Feature completion** - Implement missing CLI commands and options

### Development Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/spec-kit-assistant.git
cd spec-kit-assistant
npm install

# Test what currently works
node test-basic.js
node demo.js
```
