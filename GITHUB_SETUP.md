# 🚀 GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## ✅ Repository Created Successfully!

I've successfully created your GitHub repository:
**https://github.com/M0nkeyFl0wer/spec-kit-assistant**

## 📤 To Push Your Code

Since there was an authentication issue, you can push the code manually with these commands:

```bash
# Make sure you're in the project directory
cd /data/data/com.termux/files/home/spec-kit-assistant

# Push to the repository
git push -u origin master
```

### Option 2: If SSH doesn't work, use HTTPS with Personal Access Token
```bash
# If you need to re-authenticate
gh auth login

# Then push
git push -u origin master
```
