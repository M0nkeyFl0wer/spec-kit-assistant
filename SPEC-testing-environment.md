# Testing Environment Infrastructure Specification
**Project**: Spec Kit Assistant
**Feature**: Comprehensive Testing Environment
**Priority**: Critical (Production Blocker)
**Created**: 2025-09-27

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Create production-ready testing infrastructure for Spec Kit Assistant with 90%+ coverage, automated security validation, and comprehensive integration testing.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer contributing to Spec Kit Assistant, I need a comprehensive testing environment that validates code quality, security, and functionality before production deployment.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new feature implementation, **When** tests are run, **Then** all unit tests pass with detailed coverage reports
2. **Given** a code change, **When** security tests execute, **Then** no vulnerabilities are detected and security compliance is verified
3. **Given** the full system, **When** integration tests run, **Then** all agent swarm interactions work correctly end-to-end
4. **Given** performance requirements, **When** load tests execute, **Then** system meets response time and throughput benchmarks

### Edge Cases
- What happens when external dependencies are unavailable during testing?
- How does the test suite handle resource constraints and memory limits?
- How are flaky tests identified and managed?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide unit test framework covering all core modules (Character, Consultation, Swarm, Security)
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate code coverage reports with minimum 90% threshold enforcement
- **FR-003**: System MUST include security testing for path traversal, input validation, and authentication
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide integration tests for agent swarm orchestration and WebSocket communication
- **FR-005**: System MUST include performance benchmarks for CLI startup time (<2s) and memory usage (<100MB)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide mock environments for all external dependencies (file system, network, cloud services)
- **FR-007**: System MUST validate GitHub Spec Kit compliance and format validation
- **FR-008**: System MUST include automated linting and code quality checks (ESLint, security rules)

### Technical Requirements
- **TR-001**: Testing framework MUST use Jest for consistency with Node.js ecosystem
- **TR-002**: Mocking MUST use Sinon.js and mock-fs for comprehensive dependency isolation
- **TR-003**: Coverage reporting MUST integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated quality gates
- **TR-004**: Security testing MUST include OWASP compliance validation
- **TR-005**: Performance testing MUST measure real-world usage scenarios

### Key Entities
- **Test Suite**: Collection of unit, integration, and security tests with coverage tracking
- **Mock Environment**: Isolated testing environment with controllable external dependencies
- **Coverage Report**: Detailed analysis of code execution during test runs
- **Security Validation**: Automated security scanning and vulnerability detection
- **Performance Benchmark**: Measurable performance criteria and monitoring

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Test Infrastructure
1. Configure Jest testing framework
2. Set up coverage reporting with c8
3. Implement test utilities and helpers
4. Create mock providers for file system and network operations

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Test Suites
1. Unit tests for all core modules
2. Integration tests for agent swarm functionality
3. Security tests for all input validation and path handling
4. Performance benchmarks for critical operations

### Phase 3: Automation & CI Integration
1. Automated test execution in CI/CD pipeline
2. Quality gates with coverage thresholds
3. Security scanning integration
4. Performance regression detection
