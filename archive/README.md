# Archive

This folder contains legacy assets from earlier iterations of Spec Kit Assistant. They are no longer maintained, but preserved for historical reference.

## legacy-node/
- Original Node.js wrappers, swarm scripts, installers, and related security utilities
- Deprecated source directories (`src/character`, `src/launcher`, etc.)

## sample-projects/
- Old example workspaces such as `my-project/` and `Your-Little-Helper/`

## misc/
- Generated files and directories from previous tooling (`memory/`, `logs/`, legacy `package.json` / `node_modules`, etc.)

Only the Python-based `here_spec` package in `src/here_spec/` is considered active going forward.
