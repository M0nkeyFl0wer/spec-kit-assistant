# Next Steps - Security and Repository Cleanup

## ✅ What's Been Done

1. **Sanitized all public files**
   - Removed hardcoded SSH credentials (REMOTE_HOST, REMOTE_USER, port 8888)
   - Replaced with environment variables: `${REMOTE_HOST}`, `${REMOTE_PORT}`, `${REMOTE_USER}`

2. **Enhanced .gitignore**
   - Added comprehensive rules to prevent credential leaks
   - Excluded development/building files from public repo
   - Protected .env, logs, and build artifacts

3. **Removed private files from repo**
   - BASH-COMMANDS.md
   - deploy-to-seshat.sh
   - deploy-web3-scaffold-eth-swarm.js
   - ROADMAP.md and ROADMAP-SUMMARY.md (user trashed these)
   - pintrestcontentbot/ directory (not part of this project)

4. **Documentation**
   - Created SECURITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md explaining all changes
   - Created clean-git-history.sh script for removing secrets from history

5. **Committed changes**
   - Commit 4c0d61a: "Security: Remove SSH credentials and sanitize repository"

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: What You MUST Do Next

### 1. Clean Git History (REQUIRED!)

The previous commits (c637e43 and faad360) still contain the SSH credentials in git history.

**Option A: Use the provided script (recommended)**
```bash
# This will rewrite git history to remove all sensitive strings
./clean-git-history.sh

# Review the changes
git log --oneline

# Force push to GitHub (DESTRUCTIVE!)
git push origin main --force
```

**Option B: Use BFG Repo-Cleaner (alternative)**
```bash
# Install BFG
brew install bfg  # Mac
# OR
wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/madgag/bfg/1.14.0/bfg-1.14.0.jar

# Run BFG
java -jar bfg-1.14.0.jar --replace-text sensitive-strings.txt

# Force push
git push origin main --force
```

**Option C: Manual filter-branch**
```bash
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'find . -type f -exec sed -i "s/seshat\.noosworx\.com/REMOTE_HOST/g" {} \;' HEAD
git push origin main --force
```

### 2. Update .env File

Create your local `.env` file with real credentials:
```bash
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your actual values
nano .env
```

### 3. Verify GitHub Repository

After force pushing, check:
1. Browse repository on GitHub
2. Search for "seshat", "m0nkey", "8888"
3. Verify no results found
4. Check commit history for credentials

### 4. Notify Collaborators (if any)

If anyone else has cloned the repo, they need to:
```bash
# Backup their local work
git stash

# Delete and re-clone
cd ..
rm -rf spec-kit-assistant
git clone git@github.com:M0nkeyFl0wer/spec-kit-assistant.git
cd spec-kit-assistant

# Restore their work
git stash pop
```

## 📋 Before Pushing to GitHub Again

### Pre-Flight Checklist

Run this before every push:
```bash
# 1. Search for any secrets
git diff | grep -iE "(password|secret|key|seshat|m0nkey|:REMOTE_PORT)"

# 2. Review what's being committed
git diff --cached --name-status

# 3. Check .gitignore is working
git status --short | grep "^\?"  # Should not show .env, logs/, etc.

# 4. Verify no private files staged
git diff --cached --name-only | grep -E "(swarm|deploy|BASH-COMMANDS)"

# If any of the above find matches, STOP and investigate!
```

## 🏗️ Building a New Roadmap

You mentioned the roadmap needs to be redone. When you're ready:

1. Create a new ROADMAP.md (will stay local per .gitignore)
2. Focus on public-facing features only
3. No internal SSH details, server names, or operational specifics
4. Get approval before committing
5. Consider making roadmap public-friendly or keeping it entirely private

## 📖 Files That Are Now Public (on GitHub)

Safe for public viewing:
- ✅ spec-assistant.js
- ✅ enhanced-swarm-orchestrator.js
- ✅ src/ (all source code)
- ✅ package.json
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ SPEC.md
- ✅ CONSTITUTION.md
- ✅ .env.example
- ✅ .gitignore
- ✅ SECURITY-IMPROVEMENTS.md
- ✅ COMMANDS.md

## 📁 Files That Stay Private (local only)

Never committed:
- ❌ .env (your real credentials)
- ❌ BASH-COMMANDS.md (operational details)
- ❌ ROADMAP.md (internal planning)
- ❌ deploy-*.sh (deployment scripts)
- ❌ *-swarm.js (building/testing)
- ❌ logs/, test*/, template/
- ❌ GRANT-APPLICATION-SUMMARY.md

## 🔒 Future Prevention

### 1. Set up pre-commit hook
```bash
cat > .git/hooks/pre-commit << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
if git diff --cached | grep -iE "(seshat|m0nkey|:REMOTE_PORT|password=|secret=)"; then
    echo "❌ ERROR: Potential secret detected in commit!"
    echo "Review your changes and remove sensitive data."
    exit 1
fi
EOF

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### 2. Enable GitHub secret scanning
1. Go to repository Settings
2. Security & analysis
3. Enable "Secret scanning"
4. Enable "Push protection"

### 3. Use environment variables ALWAYS
Never hardcode:
- Hostnames
- Usernames
- Ports
- Passwords
- API keys
- File paths

## 💡 Lessons Learned

1. **Constitution and training didn't catch it** - We need:
   - Pre-commit hooks (automated checking)
   - Better grep patterns in review process
   - Clearer .gitignore from the start

2. **Building files shouldn't be public** - Only ship:
   - Working code
   - Documentation
   - Configuration examples

3. **Credentials in history are permanent** - Once committed:
   - Assume credentials are compromised
   - Change passwords/keys immediately
   - Rewrite git history to remove
   - Rotate any exposed secrets

## ✅ Current Status

- ✅ Public files sanitized
- ✅ .gitignore configured
- ✅ Security documentation added
- ✅ Development files removed from repo
- ⚠️  Git history still contains old credentials
- ⚠️  Force push needed to GitHub

## 🎯 Immediate Action Required

1. Run `./clean-git-history.sh`
2. Force push to GitHub: `git push origin main --force`
3. Verify secrets removed: Search GitHub for "seshat"
4. Create local .env file with real credentials
5. Consider rotating the exposed SSH credentials
