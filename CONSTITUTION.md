# Spec Kit Assistant Constitution
## Production Readiness Principles & Guidelines

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** September 27, 2025
**Status:** Active

---

## 🏛️ Core Principles

### 1. **Reliability First**
> "Every feature must work consistently across all environments"

- All code must have comprehensive test coverage (90%+ for critical paths)
- Zero tolerance for production-breaking changes
- Graceful degradation when external services fail
- Robust error handling with meaningful user feedback

### 2. **Security by Design**
> "Security is not optional, it's foundational"

- All user inputs must be validated and sanitized
- Path traversal protection is mandatory
- Rate limiting on all external-facing endpoints
- Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning

### 3. **Performance & Efficiency**
> "Fast is a feature, slow is a bug"

- CLI startup time must be under 2 seconds
- Memory usage must remain under 100MB baseline
- Agent operations must be non-blocking
- Resource cleanup is mandatory

### 4. **Developer Experience**
> "Code should be self-documenting and maintainable"

- Dependency injection for all external dependencies
- Clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Standardized error patterns

### 5. **User-Centric Design**
> "Every interaction should delight the user"

- Spec character provides friendly guidance
- Clear progress indicators for long operations
- Helpful error messages with suggested solutions
- Consistent CLI interface patterns

## 📋 Production Readiness Constitution

### Article I: Code Quality Standards

#### Section 1: Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:** Minimum 90% coverage for all core modules
- **Integration Tests:** All major workflows must have integration tests
- **Security Tests:** Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
- **Performance Tests:** Benchmark validation on every release

#### Section 2: Code Structure
- **Dependency Injection:** All external dependencies must be injectable
- **Provider Pattern:** File system, network, and cloud operations must use providers
- **Configuration Management:** Environment-based configuration only
- **Error Handling:** Structured error objects with context

#### Section 3: Documentation
- **API Documentation:** JSDoc for all public methods

- **User Guides:** Comprehensive documentation for all features
- **Runbooks:** Operational procedures for production issues

### Article II: Security Framework

#### Section 1: Input Validation
```javascript
// MANDATORY: All user inputs must be validated
function validateUserInput(input, schema) {
  if (!input || typeof input !== 'string') {
    throw new SecurityError('Invalid input type');
  }
  // Additional validation logic
}
```

#### Section 2: Path Security
- All file operations must use `secure-path.js` utilities
- No direct file system access outside of providers
- Path traversal protection on all user-provided paths
- Whitelist approach for allowed file extensions

#### Section 3: Authentication & Authorization
- WebSocket connections must authenticate
- Rate limiting on all public endpoints
- Audit logging for all security-relevant operations
- Token-based authentication with expiration

### Article III: Performance Standards

#### Section 1: Response Time Requirements
- **CLI Commands:** < 2 seconds for simple operations
- **Spec Generation:** < 5 seconds for standard projects
- **Agent Communication:** < 100ms response time
- **File Operations:** < 1 second for typical files

#### Section 2: Resource Management
- **Memory:** Baseline under 100MB, peak under 500MB
- **CPU:** Non-blocking operations for all I/O
- **Network:** Connection pooling for external services
- **Cleanup:** Explicit resource cleanup in all modules

#### Section 3: Scalability
- Support for 50+ concurrent agent connections
- Horizontal scaling capability
- Graceful degradation under load
- Circuit breaker pattern for external services

### Article IV: Development Workflow

#### Section 1: Branching Strategy
- **main:** Production-ready code only
- **develop:** Integration branch for features
- **feature/*:** Individual feature development
- **hotfix/*:** Critical production fixes

#### Section 2: Code Review Process
- All changes require peer review
- Automated checks must pass before merge
- Security review for sensitive changes
- Performance impact assessment

#### Section 3: Release Process
- Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Automated testing on all environments
- Staged rollout with monitoring
- Rollback procedures documented

### Article V: Monitoring & Observability

#### Section 1: Logging Standards
```javascript
// MANDATORY: Structured logging format
logger.info('Agent deployed', {
  agentId: 'qa-001',
  agentType: 'quality-assurance',
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
});
```

#### Section 2: Metrics Collection
- Application performance metrics
- Business metrics (usage, adoption)
- Error rates and types
- Resource utilization

#### Section 3: Alerting
- Critical error thresholds
- Performance degradation alerts
- Security incident notifications
- Resource limit warnings

## 🔧 Implementation Guidelines

### Dependency Injection Pattern
```javascript
// MANDATORY: Use this pattern for all services
class ServiceClass {
  constructor(dependencies = {}) {
    this.fileSystem = dependencies.fileSystem || new FileSystemProvider();
    this.network = dependencies.network || new NetworkProvider();
    this.logger = dependencies.logger || new Logger();
  }
}
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```javascript
// MANDATORY: Structured error handling
class SpecKitError extends Error {
  constructor(message, code, context = {}) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'SpecKitError';
    this.code = code;
    this.context = context;
    this.timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  }
}
```

### Configuration Management
```javascript
// MANDATORY: Environment-based configuration
const config = {
  port: process.env.PORT || 3000,
  logLevel: process.env.LOG_LEVEL || 'info',
  nodeEnv: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',
  security: {
    enabled: process.env.SECURITY_MODE === 'strict',
    rateLimit: parseInt(process.env.RATE_LIMIT) || 100
  }
};
```

### Testing Standards
```javascript
// MANDATORY: Test structure
describe('Component Name', () => {
  let component;
  let mockDependencies;

  beforeEach(() => {
    mockDependencies = {
      fileSystem: new MockFileSystem(),
      network: new MockNetwork()
    };
    component = new Component(mockDependencies);
  });

  test('should handle valid input correctly', () => {
    // Arrange, Act, Assert pattern
  });

  test('should handle error conditions gracefully', () => {
    // Error scenario testing
  });
});
```
