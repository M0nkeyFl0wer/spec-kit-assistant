## 🚀 **Next Steps - Let Spec Guide Your Project:**

### 1. **Configure Smart Oversight (Recommended: Trust & Verify)**
```bash
# Let agents work autonomously with strategic check-ins
node src/index.js oversight --mode trust-verify

# Or for more control during learning
node src/index.js oversight --mode checkpoints
```

### 2. **Start Your Project Consultation**
```bash
# Have Spec ask you about your project
node src/index.js consult

# Or use the full initialization flow
node src/index.js init
```

### 3. **Monitor Your Agents**
```bash
# Check agent status and activity
node src/index.js swarm --monitor
```

## 🎯 **Oversight Modes Explained:**

### **🤖 Trust & Verify (Recommended)**
- Agents work **90% autonomously**
- Only interrupts for **critical decisions**
- Perfect for **experienced developers**
- **3x faster development**

### **⚡ Strategic Checkpoints**
- Pauses at **major milestones**
- Good for **learning new technologies**
- **Balanced control vs. speed**

### **✋ Full Control**
- **Approve every task individually**
- Best for **sensitive projects** or **learning**
- **Maximum oversight**

## 🎬 **How Spec's Consultation Works:**

Instead of blank templates, Spec will ask you intelligent questions like:

1. **"What problem are you solving?"**
2. **"Who are your users?"**
3. **"What's your tech preference?"**
4. **"Do you need real-time features?"**
5. **"What's your deployment target?"**

Spec builds your specification **through conversation**, not forms!

## ☁️ **Cloud Integration Ready:**

Your swarm can scale to the cloud when needed:

```bash
# Setup Google Cloud Platform integration
node src/index.js cloud --gcp --optimize

# Optimize for free tier usage
node src/index.js cloud --optimize
```

**Benefits:**
- **$300 GCP free credits**
- **Always-free tier optimization**
- **40% cost savings** through intelligent resource management
- **Parallel agent processing** for complex builds

---

## 🎪 **Quick Start Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Start a new project conversation with Spec
node src/index.js init

# 2. Check your active agents
node src/index.js swarm --monitor

# 3. Set oversight mode to Trust & Verify
node src/index.js oversight --mode trust-verify

# 4. Deploy additional agents if needed
node deploy-builder-ux-swarm.js 6

# 5. Setup cloud integration
node src/index.js cloud --gcp
```
