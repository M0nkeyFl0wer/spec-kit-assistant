Tips:
- Stick to basic ASCII characters for best alignment
- Avoid Unicode (▄▀█●) if possible, use standard chars like: # @ O * = - _ |
- Use spaces at the end to reach exactly 39 characters
- The dog will appear with gradient colors: gold → orange → blue

Color mapping (applied automatically):
- Lines 1-2: Golden yellow (#FFD700)
- Lines 3-4: Warm orange (#F28500)
- Lines 5-6: Professional blue (#2E86AB)

When ready, paste your 6 lines back to me and I'll integrate them!
